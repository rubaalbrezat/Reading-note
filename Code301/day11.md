# SQL and NoSQL

Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
|  SQL   |    NoSQL     | 
|----------|:-------------:|
| Relational Databases |  non-relational or distributed database. |
| table based databases|  document based  |  
| have predefined schema | dynamic schema|  
|vertically scalable    |horizontally scalable|
|structured query language	|Unstructured Query Language|

## What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment whereas NoSQL databases are not good fit for complex queries.

## Give a real world example.
Practical Examples to Build a Strong Foundation in Linux

## What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.
## Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
NoSQL
## Which type of database is best for scalability?
SQL
## What does SQL stand for?
Structured Query Language
## What is a realational database?
A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.
## What type of structure does a relational database work with?
The relational model means that the logical data structures—the data tables, views, and indexes.
## What is a ‘schema’?
A schema is a collection of logical structures of data, or schema objects. A schema is owned by a database user
## What is a NoSQL database?
NoSQL is a type of database that stores and retrieves data without needing to define its structure firs.
## Howo does it work?
databases that store data in a format other than relational tables. ... NoSQL databases can store relationship data—they just store it differently than relational databases do.
## What is inside of a Mongo database?
MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections. A database stores one or more collections of documents.

## Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
While MongoDB is more flexible and ensures high and diverse data availability, a SQL Database operates with the ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability) properties and ensures greater reliability of transactions.

## What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
Don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have.
