# The secret to success? Women.

Taking the goal of gender equality to a deep level, chairman Jack Ma describes women as the “secret sauce” behind Alibaba’s dominance in the online shopping industry. More than one-third of Alibaba Group’s founders were women, and a similar percentage are in senior executive roles.

Ma went so far as to claim that “women’s perseverance and attention to details will outperform men in the age of robotics and machine learning.”

When it comes to creating programs that maximize the revenue potential inherent to gender diversity, Alibaba is an excellent example to follow.
