# Functional Programming Concepts
## q1) What is functional programming?

it is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data

## q2) What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?

the function that contains fixed data inside it, and it will not affect any other global variables as an example.
we know the function is pure by : 1- it will return the same result for same argument every time. 2- it will not make any observable side effects.

## q3) What are the benefits of a pure function?

we can test the pure functions easier than impure functions.

## q4) What is immutability?

it is the fixed data that will not be able to change over the time.

## q5) What is Referential transparency?

when we have a pure function with immutable data then we will have the referential transparency.
