# Redux

Redux is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.

Redux provides a solid, stable, and mature solution to managing state in your React application. Through a handful of small, useful patterns, Redux can transform your application from a total mess of confusing and scattered state, into a delightfully organized, easy to understand modern JavaScript powerhouse.

## Should You Use Redux?
Redux is a valuable tool for organizing your state, but you should also consider whether it's appropriate for your situation. Don't use Redux just because someone said you should - take some time to understand the potential benefits and tradeoffs of using it.

## Here are some suggestions on when it makes sense to use Redux:

1. You have reasonable amounts of data changing over time
2. You need a single source of truth for your state
3. You find that keeping all your state in a top-level component is no longer sufficient

Redux is a pattern and library for managing and updating application state, using events called "actions". It serves as a centralized store for state that needs to be used across your entire application, with rules ensuring that the state can only be updated in a predictable fashion.

## Redux is more useful when:

You have large amounts of application state that are needed in many places in the app
The app state is updated frequently over time
The logic to update that state may be complex
The app has a medium or large-sized codebase, and might be worked on by many people
