# Graph
A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges. The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More formally a Graph can be defined as, A Graph consisting of a finite set of vertices(or nodes) and a set of edges that connect a pair of nodes.

Properties of Graphs are basically used for the characterization of graphs depending on their structures. 
Difference between graph and tree

## graph
Graph is a non-linear data structure.
It is a collection of vertices/nodes and edges.
Each node can have any number of edges.
There is no unique node called root in graph.
A cycle can be formed.
For graph traversal, we use Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS)

## tree
Tree is a non-linear data structure.
It is a collection of nodes and edges.
If there is n nodes then there would be n-1 number of edges
They are always directed
There is a unique node called root(parent) node in trees.
There will not be any cycle.
We traverse a tree using in-order, pre-order, or post-order traversal methods.
For game trees, decision trees, the tree is used.
