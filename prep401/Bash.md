# The Command Line
## What is The Command Line?
A command line, or terminal, is a text based interface to the system. You are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.

## how get to one?
using terminal


## what is shell?
his is a part of the operating system that defines how the terminal will behave and looks after running (or executing) commands for you.

# Basic Navigation
 pwd : to know where are we.
 ls :  to Know what in Our Current Location.
 ~ (tilde) : This is a shortcut for your home directory.
 . (dot) : This is a reference to your current directory.
 cd : which stands for change directory.
 /etc : Stores config files for the system.
 /var/log : Stores log files for various system programs.
 /bin : The location of several commonly used programs
 /usr/bin : Another location for programs on the system.
 
 ## Relative path
A file or directory location relative to where we currently are in the file system.
Absolute path
A file or directory location in relation to the root of the file system.

# More About Files!
path : is a means to get to a particular location in the system and that location is a file.
Linux is Case Sensitive.
spaces in file and directory names are perfectly valid but we need to be a little careful with them.
-a : show hidden files and directories.

# Manual Pages
man : Look up the manual page for a particular command.
man -k : Do a keyword search for all manual pages containing the given search term.
/<term> :Within a manual page, perform a search for 'term'
n : After performing a search within a manual page, select the next found item.

The man pages are your friend.
Instead of trying to remember everything, instead remember you can easily look stuff up in the man pages.

# File Manipulation
mkdir : Make Directory - ie. Create a directory.
rmdir : Remove Directory - ie. Delete a directory.
touch :Create a blank file.
cp : Copy - ie. Copy a file or directory.
mv : Move - ie. Move a file or directory (can also be used to rename).
rm: Remove - ie. Delete a file.

## No undo
The Linux command line does not have an undo feature. Perform destructive actions carefully.
## Command line options
Most commands have many useful command line options. Make sure you skim the man page for new commands so you are familiar with what they can do and what is available.
